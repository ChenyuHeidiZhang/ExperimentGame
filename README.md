# ExperimentGame

App developed for a multi-attribute decision making experiment.

Mar 21, 2020

Up to this point, each trial in the experiment only consists of 2 choices each containing 2 attributes (probability and amount).

The current plan is to extend it to include trials with 4 choices and choices with 4 attributes (probability of winning, winning amount, probability of losing, losing amount).
