# ExperimentGame
This branch is based on the master_survey branch (with survey)
This branch is almost the same version as master2.0 besides the fact that it has a survey portion
In this version, the following changes are made:

**1. We add the feature that on the result page/total amount page, if the user doesn't press "next" button, the page will shift to the next one automatically after 5 seconds (5 seconds after the "next" button is shown)**

**2. We change the block size from 160 to 5**

**3. The wording on the totalAmount result page is changed to "Total Amount Won So Far"**

**4. The wording in the database is updated: if the page is changed automatically, there will be a line "Auto change page after 5 seconds" before "Next button clicked"**
